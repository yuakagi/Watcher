    Discretizes the percentile space [0, 1].

    A uniform grid is applied in logit space to create finer resolution near 0 and 1,
    which helps capture long-tailed distributions. The logit grid is transformed back to [0, 1]
    using the sigmoid function.
    Each resulting bin is assigned a uniformly spaced numeric label in [0.0, 1.0].

    Args:
        num_bins (int): Number of bins to divide the percentile space.
        eps (float): Small offset to avoid logit(0) and logit(1). Default is 1e-7.

    Returns:
        percentile_steps (np.ndarray): Non-uniform percentile bin edges with finer resolution near 0 and 1.
